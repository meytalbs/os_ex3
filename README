This program receives using the argument vector a natural number.

The program repeats the following task 50 times:
first will randomize an array of with the size of 50,0000
it cerates two children:
    Child A will sort the array using bubbles sort.
    Child B will sort the array using quick sort.

Each child sends information to their dad:
A. Which sort was preformd: b or q
B. How long did it take to sort the array.
the dad will read the time it took to sort and and it to the right struct
during the sort it will save the fastest and slowest time.

Input: (in argument vector) number_to_srand
Output: 7 informations: 
   1. How long on average did it take to bubbles sort the data, 
   2. How long did it take to quick sort.
   3. Fastest time a child has run a bubble sort 
   4. Fastest time a child has run a quick sort.
   5. Slowest time a child who has sorted using bubble sort.
   6. Slowest time a child who has sorted using quick sort.
   7. program run time.
